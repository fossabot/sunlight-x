Sunlight highlighter modernized for node.js.
While the highlighter can be run, it is still a WIP.


# Usage

The API of the highlighter is still evolving.
Please read the test to infer on how to use the highlighter.


# TODO

- Put the original code in modules (and classes in some cases).
- Reorganize API
- Add tests
- Browserify
- Clarify owners of code snippets (some unknown code are used now).
